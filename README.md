# santandercoders_bigdata1_project
Objective: Identify when pandas or pyspark libraries are better comparing to the other through a simple ETL.
 
On this repository it will have the code files which will be used on Databricks for the following experimental use:

1) Extract 2 different sizes datasets.

2) Transform data and exploratory data analysis using both libraries (pandas and pyspark)

3) Load the data.

Note: We are aware that it is possible to manually integrate the Github with Databricks but unfortunately it is only for Premium users of Databricks.
